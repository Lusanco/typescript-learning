# A First App

**Fetch JSON - Simple TypeScript Project**: This project is a simple TypeScript application that demonstrates how to make a network request to an external API using Axios. It highlights TypeScript's ability to catch errors during development rather than runtime.

## Project Overview

**The goal of this project is to**:

- Fetch data from an external API (a fake To-Do API).
- Display a single To-Do item in the terminal.
- Show how TypeScript helps catch bugs during the development process.

## Technologies Used

**TypeScript**: To demonstrate its workflow and benefits.
**Axios**: For making network requests to the API.
**Node.js & NPM**: For managing dependencies.
Steps to Reproduce
